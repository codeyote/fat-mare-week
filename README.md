This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## The Idea

We've got a farm. On this farm, we have some horses and some goats. At times, some of those horses and goats are inside other horses and goats. Generally, what is inside eventually exits (except when it doesn't; trust that there are diagrams and a great many pictures that don't need to be included here regarding that possibility). When this happens is, of course, a grand mystery optimized for maximum human inconvenience.

We also know an assortment of people who like to watch animals frolic and who can probably be convinced to push a big red button if they happen to see the miracle of birth take place. Hence: can we put a big red button next to a video of animals? Yes we can. And can that big red button eventually send us a barrage of attention-getting texts in the middle of the night? Subject to toll-free number verification requirements and screenshots of our opt-in flow, eventually also yes.

Granted that if anyone sees the miracle of birth on this thing currently we will have learned a new and surprising fact about Big Buck Bunny, but eventually the video in question will be a little more representative of the farm and also a bit more current.

## Why?

Why not?

Is there something out there that does this already? Quite possibly, or at least it seems like there ought to be such a thing. It's possibly even written by someone who has been doing front-end development for more days than they can count on their fingers and possibly has not spent an entire morning wrestling with how to make elements go in sensible places and be in vaguely sane sizes. That latter statement is admittedly a tad naive but we'll go with it.

On the other hand, it's also surprising how having a slightly niche use case such as "camera to be installed outdoors on a semi-rural property that isn't particularly meant to be used by members of the household as a security camera" leaves one out in the desert and resorting to sharing accounts on the sketchy cloud app from some vendor with a keyboard-smashy name. Given this, a somewhat keyboard-smashy web app is already a step in a positive direction and things seem likely to improve from here.
